 * 		See Page:408 of the manual: Section Example Timer Calculations
 *		Assuming 12 Mhz, and a 1 second period we would want 12Mil - 1 for the LOAD value.
 *		CTRL |= (1<<0) | (1<< 2) gave me a period of 500 ms.
 *			LOAD value of 24Mil results in an overflow because we only have 24 bits.
 *		CTR: |= (1<<0);
 *		CTRL &= ~(1<<2);
 *			LOAD value of 12Million, resulted in the correct period, you must have bit 2 be 0. and bit 0 to be 1.
