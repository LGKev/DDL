  (1) If it's a I2C write only, the number of bytes to be written is
  I2CWriteLength, I2CReadLength is zero, the content will be filled
  in the I2CMasterBuffer.
  (2) If it's a I2C read only, the number of bytes to be read is
  I2CReadLength, I2CWriteLength is 0, the read value will be filled
  in the I2CMasterBuffer.
  (3) If it's a I2C Write/Read with repeated start, specify the
  I2CWriteLength, fill the content of bytes to be written in
  I2CMasterBuffer, specify the I2CReadLength, after the repeated
  start and the device address with RD bit set, the content of the
  reading will be filled in I2CMasterBuffer index at
  I2CMasterBuffer[I2CWriteLength+2].

  e.g. Start, DevAddr(W), WRByte1...WRByteN, Repeated-Start, DevAddr(R),
  RDByte1...RDByteN Stop. The content of the reading will be filled
  after (I2CWriteLength + two devaddr) bytes. */
